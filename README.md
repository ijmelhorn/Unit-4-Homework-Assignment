Used quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. Created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas.
